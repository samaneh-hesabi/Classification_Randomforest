<div style="font-size:2.5em; font-weight:bold; text-align:center; margin-top:20px;">Wine Quality Classification using Random Forest</div>

# 1. Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and classifying wine quality using machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest classification. The goal is to predict wine quality based on various chemical properties and understand which features most significantly impact wine quality.

## 1.1 Problem Statement
The project aims to:
- Analyze the relationship between chemical properties and wine quality
- Build a predictive model for wine quality classification
- Identify the most important features affecting wine quality
- Provide insights for wine production and quality control

# 1.2 Dataset Description
The dataset contains 1599 samples of red wine with 12 features:

### Chemical Properties
- Fixed acidity: Most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile
- Volatile acidity: The amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high levels can lead to an unpleasant vinegar taste
- Citric acid: Found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines
- Residual sugar: The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops
- Chlorides: The amount of salt in the wine
- Free sulfur dioxide: The free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion
- Total sulfur dioxide: Amount of free and bound forms of S02
- Density: The density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content
- pH: Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic)
- Sulphates: A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels
- Alcohol: The percent alcohol content of the wine

### Target Variable
- Quality: Score between 0 and 10 (ordinal variable)
